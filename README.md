# To-Do-List

This project was made with Xcode and Swift 3.0.

Followed the tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrCqXmHenJY to create a to do list that has the following functionalities:
  - Slide to delete items from the list
  - Append items to the bottom of the list
  
First view displays the list while the second view allows you to add items to the list.
